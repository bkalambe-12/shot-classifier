# Cricket Shot Classifier:
This project implements a Python-based cricket shot classifier using NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas for data manipulation and analysis. It aims to automatically identify different types of shots played by a batsman in cricket videos or images.

## Features:
1.Classifies various cricket shots (e.g., drive, cover drive, pull, sweep, etc.)

2.Utilizes machine learning techniques for accurate classification

3.Leverages Python libraries for efficient data handling and visualization (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)

## Tech Stack:
* Python
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* ML library: Tensorflow
